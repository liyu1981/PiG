# Pig extension authoring

Pig extensions target the upstream pi extension API through the subprocess
bridge. The language-specific SDKs are bridges into the same protocol, not
separate APIs.

Read these files before adding or changing extension behavior:

1. `docs/extension-api-parity.md`: parity boundary and SDK coverage matrix.
2. `docs/parity/DIVERGENCES.md`: numbered intentional differences from upstream pi.
3. `coding/extension/host/subprocess/protocol.go`: canonical wire protocol.
4. `extensions/sdk/`, `extensions/sdk-rs/`, `extensions/sdk-py/`: SDK bridges.
5. `extensions/sdk-ts/`: declarations for Pi-compatible TypeScript extensions and PiG-only additions.
6. `test/extension-conformance/conformance_test.go`: cross-SDK behavior gate.

## Hard rules

- Do not add a WASM runtime.
- Do not add an embedded JavaScript runtime.
- Do not add dynamic Go plugins or `plugin.Open`.
- Do not add a general dynamic linked/in-process extension loader. Piglet builds
  may fuse compatible reviewed Go SDK factories through the governed D31 path;
  the subprocess host remains the semantic reference.
- Do not introduce multi-register (`RegisterPayload.Extensions`,
  `RequestPayload.TargetExtension`) unless a new approved spec explicitly
  chooses it. Packed cells currently use the current subprocess wire with one socket per
  contained extension.
- If a behavior differs from upstream pi, either fix it or add a numbered
  `D<N>` entry to `docs/parity/DIVERGENCES.md` with call-site markers and tests.

## Translating TypeScript behavior to Go

Read [TypeScript-to-Go porting](typescript-to-go-porting.md) before choosing a
Go representation. In particular, an upstream TypeScript interface is a
consumer-visible shape, not an instruction to add a Go interface. Extension
protocol interfaces are justified public boundaries; extension data and helper
implementations should remain concrete unless a consumer needs substitution.
Do not reshape the public extension API to satisfy a generic interface linter or
an unmeasured performance claim.

### Async behavior

A Promise is a contract, not an instruction to start a goroutine. For every
upstream `async`, `Promise`, `.then`, `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, or deliberately
unawaited call, inspect its callers and preserve:

1. whether the caller waits for completion;
2. result and error propagation;
3. completion ordering;
4. cancellation and lifetime ownership;
5. serial versus concurrent execution;
6. which event/UI loop owns callbacks and state mutation.

### Awaited handler: return only after the work finishes

TypeScript:

```ts
pi.registerCommand("refresh", {
  async handler(_args, ctx) {
    const models = await refreshModels(ctx.signal);
    ctx.ui.notify(`Loaded ${models.length} models`, "info");
  },
});
```

Go SDK:

```go
ext.Command("refresh", "Refresh models.", func(ctx sdk.Context, _ string) error {
    models, err := refreshModels(ctx.Done())
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    ctx.Notify(fmt.Sprintf("Loaded %d models", len(models)), "info")
    return nil
})
```

The Go subprocess SDK already runs each inbound handler on its own goroutine.
Blocking inside the handler preserves upstream `await`: the host receives the
response only when the callback completes. Wrapping the body in another
`go func()` and returning `nil` early changes ordering, drops the returned error,
and cancels the handler-scoped `sdk.Context` as soon as the handler returns.

### Per-run prompt sections

`before_agent_start` handlers can edit `event.systemPromptOptions.sections`. PiG preserves authored section order, validates XML tag names, records section deltas in the Session, and removes a per-run section when the next unmodified run starts. The host awaits the handler and retains section mutations before it reports an error. These mutations do not change the Session's base options.

The Go SDK supplies `*sdk.SystemPromptSections` rather than a Go map because map iteration cannot retain insertion order. Use `Set` and `Delete` on that collection:

```go
ext.OnEvent("before_agent_start", func(_ sdk.Context, data map[string]any) (any, error) {
    options := data["systemPromptOptions"].(map[string]any)
    options["sections"].(*sdk.SystemPromptSections).Set("plan_mode", "Plan only.")
    return nil, nil
})
```

Node and Python handlers edit the section object or dictionary. Rust handlers edit the ordered JSON value and can use `on_event_result` to return an error. Native Go reference handlers use `extension.BeforeAgentStartOptions(ctx)` to access the shared per-run options and mutate its `Sections`, an `*ai.OrderedSections`. `BeforeAgentStartEvent.SystemPromptOptions` remains a value for source compatibility; assign collection replacements through the accessor. This transport carries section values, not cross-process object aliases.

### Per-run tool loadout

`before_agent_start` handlers can also edit or replace `event.systemPromptOptions.selectedTools`. When the final list differs from the list the handlers received, it becomes the executable and provider tool loadout, as Pi's `agent-session.ts` does, and it stays active after the run. An unchanged list keeps the live loadout, so a `setActiveTools` call inside the handler stays in effect. The run's prompt lists the resulting tools in print, RPC and interactive modes. Later handlers see the edit. The edit survives a handler error. The Session's base options do not change.

Every SDK presents the list as a list, and an empty loadout arrives as an empty list. The Go SDK uses `[]any`, so assign the result of `append`:

```go
ext.OnEvent("before_agent_start", func(_ sdk.Context, data map[string]any) (any, error) {
    options := data["systemPromptOptions"].(map[string]any)
    options["selectedTools"] = append(options["selectedTools"].([]any), "my_tool")
    return nil, nil
})
```

Node handlers use the array (`event.systemPromptOptions.selectedTools.push("my_tool")`), Python handlers the list, and Rust handlers the JSON array. Native Go reference handlers assign `extension.BeforeAgentStartOptions(ctx).SelectedTools`. Duplicate names are removed in first-seen order before admission. Non-string entries cannot select registered tools. A final `null` list rejects the prompt after the handler chain; a later handler can repair it. An invalid section name also rejects the prompt, but only after the deduplicated loadout is admitted, so the loadout stays active as in Pi. Rejection emits no `agent_start` or `agent_settled`. The idle system prompt returns to the base options even though the edited loadout stays active.

### Parallel work: start together, then join

TypeScript `await Promise.all([loadA(), loadB()])` requires both operations to be
owned and joined. In Go, start both operations, collect both results/errors, and
return only after both complete. Use `errgroup.WithContext` when the project
already depends on `x/sync`, or an explicit `sync.WaitGroup` plus result/error
channels. Do not detach either goroutine, and do not let two goroutines mutate the
same map, slice, SDK state, or UI object without synchronization.

### Fire-and-forget is exceptional

Only detach work when the upstream caller intentionally does not await it.
Detached Go work must have an owner that:

- supplies cancellation independent of the completed request context;
- reports errors instead of discarding them;
- prevents writes after shutdown/reload;
- joins or drains the task during extension shutdown when upstream does.

A naked `go func()` with ignored error is not a valid translation of a Promise.

### UI and cancellation

Upstream Promise-based dialogs (`select`, `confirm`, `input`, `editor`) map to
blocking Go SDK calls because the handler is already off the host UI loop. In
interactive mode that includes the `input` event: a handler registered for it
runs on its own goroutine, one dispatch at a time, and the rest of the prompt
path is applied on the owner loop when the handlers return. An input handler may
therefore open a dialog and wait for the answer. With no `input` handler loaded
there is nothing that can suspend the dispatch, and the prompt path stays
synchronous, because several of the loop's guarantees are stated in terms of a
submission being fully dispatched before the loop reads the next keystroke.

A handler that blocks on the owner loop instead of beside it deadlocks the
terminal: the loop is what installs a dialog and feeds it keystrokes, so Enter
appears to do nothing and no key responds again, with nothing on screen to
explain it. The same applies to `model_select`, which interactive mode emits
from the loop while `/model` runs.

For
Pig core/in-process code, slow work leaves the TUI loop and every UI mutation
returns through the approved run-on-main mechanism. Map `AbortSignal` to
`context.Context`, `sdk.Context.Done()`, or the owning lifetime's cancellation
channel and test cancellation before and during the operation.

Pi's `ctx.signal` is the signal of the run in progress, not of the handler's request: it is `undefined` while no run is active (a command or `session_start` while idle), one object for the whole run, and aborted with the run even while a handler is still in flight. Node exposes it as `ctx.signal`, the Go SDK as `ctx.Signal()` (a `context.Context`, nil while no run is active), Python as `ctx.signal` and Rust as `ctx.signal()` (a `ProviderSignal`, `None` while no run is active). `sdk.Context.Done()`, `Err()` and Rust and Python `is_cancelled()` report the handler's own request, which the host cancels when it abandons that request.

### Subprocess request liveness

The SDK answers host heartbeat on its socket dispatcher. Extension handlers do
not implement heartbeat. Each request reports lifecycle state automatically.
Calls that wait for `select`, `confirm`, `input`, `editor`, or `custom` report
`blocked:user`. Other awaited host calls report `blocked:host_call`.
The wire also reserves `blocked:external_io` for an operation whose runtime can
identify that boundary.

Tools, commands, events, and shortcuts may run until they return, the caller
cancels them, the transport closes, or heartbeat fails. Renderer inactivity
cancels only the current generation and preserves its last completed frame.
Cancellation also closes a blocked host/UI call that carries the request as its
parent.

### Session history

Session history stays unloaded until an extension calls `getEntries` or
`getBranch`. For a persisted session, each subprocess reads the local JSONL file
once and then subscribes at that cursor. The host sends missing history and later
appends in ordered pages of at most 4 MB. A missing or unreadable file uses the
same paged host path from cursor zero. Returned containers are shallow copies;
treat their entries as read-only.

### Focused subprocess components

`ctx.ui.custom()` remains extension-owned in subprocess realizations. The SDK
constructs and renders the component locally; Pig opens a native focus-owning
overlay and transports only ordered input, replaceable line snapshots, and the
terminal result/error. Snapshots carry their render width and a monotone
per-overlay sequence; the host rejects stale-width and out-of-order frames.
Core editor keybindings do not receive input while the overlay owns focus.
Identical snapshots are suppressed before transport, and host rendering reads
only the latest cached frame.

Go components implement `sdk.RemoteComponent` and may implement
`sdk.RemoteComponentDisposer`:

```go
type picker struct { selected int }

func (p *picker) Render(width int) []string {
    return []string{fmt.Sprintf("selected=%d width=%d", p.selected, width)}
}

func (p *picker) HandleInput(data string) (sdk.RemoteComponentResult, error) {
    switch data {
    case "\x1b[B":
        p.selected++
    case "\r":
        return sdk.RemoteComponentResult{Done: true, Value: p.selected}, nil
    case "\x1b":
        return sdk.RemoteComponentResult{Done: true}, nil
    }
    return sdk.RemoteComponentResult{}, nil
}
```

Call `ctx.Custom(component, sdk.RemoteOverlayOptions{Title: "Picker"})` from a
tool or command handler. The call waits until completion or cancellation.
Component input is serial per overlay. Resize and timer invalidation rerender with
the current width. Implement `RemoteComponentInvalidator` when component state
changes without input:

```go
type timerView struct {
    mu         sync.Mutex
    invalidate func()
}

func (v *timerView) SetInvalidate(invalidate func()) {
    v.mu.Lock()
    v.invalidate = invalidate
    v.mu.Unlock()
}
```

Store the callback under the same lock as timer-owned state. Call it after the
state changes. Treat the callback as a render request, not as permission to
render or mutate TUI state directly. PiG coalesces repeated requests, limits
timer-driven frame production to the TUI 16 ms render interval, and transports
only a changed frame. Input-driven frames remain immediate.

Rust implements `set_invalidate` on `RemoteComponent` and stores the optional
`RemoteComponentInvalidate` callback. Python can implement
`set_invalidate(callback)` and must accept `None` to detach. Node extensions use
the `tui.requestRender()` callback passed to the upstream component factory.

One terminal gives focus to one extension dialog or overlay at a time. A second
interactive call waits off the TUI loop. Cancellation removes a waiting call before it can
take focus. Input events stay ordered and never coalesce. Render snapshots are
replaceable and use a bounded queue.

Completion, host cancellation, transport failure, reload, and shutdown stop the
component worker. PiG rejects late frames from a completed generation. The SDK
detaches the invalidation callback before it calls `dispose` exactly once. A
component callback must return promptly. If it does not stop by the cleanup
deadline, the SDK reports the failure and does not race disposal against the
stuck callback.

Rust uses `RemoteComponent` with
`Context::custom_component`; Python uses `Context.custom(component, options)`.
The Node bridge accepts the upstream component factory directly.

### Review evidence

An async port is not complete until a test can fail for premature return,
serializing intended parallel work, lost cancellation, lost rejection/error, or
an off-loop UI mutation. Record the chosen mapping in
`docs/extension-api-parity.md` for extension API surfaces and run the same
conformance behavior in isolated and packed modes.

### Project trust handlers

Use the typed `OnProjectTrust` / `on_project_trust` helper. Handlers run in
extension and registration order. Return `undecided` to continue; the first
`yes` or `no` wins. The host awaits each handler, collects an error and
continues, and propagates cancellation through the request context. Multiple
registrations retain distinct wire handler identities; do not replace
them with one local dispatcher or start detached work.

Go:

```go
ext.OnProjectTrust(func(ctx sdk.Context, data map[string]any) (sdk.ProjectTrustResult, error) {
    return sdk.ProjectTrustResult{Trusted: sdk.ProjectTrustUndecided}, nil
})
```

Rust returns `ProjectTrustResult` with `ProjectTrustDecision`; Python returns a
`ProjectTrustResult` typed dictionary. Production trust resolution loads only
global/explicit pre-trust extensions; project-local extensions cannot decide
whether they themselves are trusted.

## Set a native login

For a custom PiG mascot, scaffold the standard PiG artwork and login
handler first:

```bash
pig extension init ./my-pig --name my-pig --login
```

Keep the generated `Brand` and `Hero` fields unchanged. Edit only the mascot,
its palette colors, and identity text.

Use `SetLogin` to give an interactive Pig session an extension-defined identity.
Pig owns the layout and operational status. The definition has one strict
current unversioned shape.

The grids have exact dimensions: `brand` is 41 by 5, `hero` is 32 by 14, and
`mascot` is 16 by 14. Use ASCII symbols in each grid. `.` means transparent.
Map every other symbol to one `#RRGGBB` color. Use at most 32 colors. A fully transparent `brand` omits the brand band, and the hero and mascot start at the top of the header.

Pig rejects unknown or duplicate fields, bad dimensions, non-ASCII grid data,
missing or unused palette symbols, invalid colors, and invalid text. `name`,
`description`, and `tagline` must be non-empty. Their display-width limits are
24, 48, and 76 columns. The combined name and description line is limited to 80
columns.

`SetLogin` and `SetHeader` use the same slot. The last successful call wins.
Clear the header to restore Stock Pig's text header. A rejected login keeps the
current header. Quiet startup keeps the slot hidden. Widths below 66 columns
show compact text without art. The host renders from local validated data and
does not call the extension during each render.

Go:

```go
err := ctx.SetLogin(sdk.LoginDefinition{
    Brand: brand, Hero: hero, Mascot: mascot, Palette: palette,
    Name: "Example Bot", Description: "Custom coding agent", Tagline: "Build with care.",
})
```

Rust:

```rust
ctx.set_login(&LoginDefinition {
    brand, hero, mascot, palette,
    name: "Example Bot".into(), description: "Custom coding agent".into(),
    tagline: "Build with care.".into(),
})?;
```

Python:

```python
ctx.set_login(LoginDefinition(
    brand=brand, hero=hero, mascot=mascot, palette=palette,
    name="Example Bot", description="Custom coding agent", tagline="Build with care.",
))
```

Node:

```js
await ctx.ui.setLogin({
  brand, hero, mascot, palette,
  name: "Example Bot", description: "Custom coding agent", tagline: "Build with care.",
});
```

Preview one extension without starting a model session:

```bash
pig extension preview-login <path>
```

The command requires exactly one extension source. It fails if resolution finds
zero or multiple extensions, `session_start` fails, no login is set, or the
login is invalid. Use `/reload` after an edit. A login remains an extension
Resource. Activate it through a Piglet `extensions` entry, user extension
policy, or `pig -e <path>`. Verify activation by starting or reloading through
that path and checking the identity name. Keep product identities outside Stock
Pig and select them through an ordinary Piglet extension entry.

### Add a sprite

Use `RegisterSprite` to add a sprite to `/sprite` without replacing the header (D2). A sprite has a lowercase slug `id` of at most 32 characters, a one-line `name` and `tagline`, a 16-by-14 `mascot` that the startup header draws as its head and `/sprite preview` draws beside the `PiG.` wordmark, and a `palette` that maps each symbol to a `#RRGGBB` color. `.` is transparent. Start from PiG's standard pig (`pigMascot` in `coding/piglogin/art.go`) so it matches the built-in sprites. The id must not be a built-in sprite's id or another extension's.

```go
err := ctx.RegisterSprite(sdk.SpriteDefinition{
    ID: "blue-pig", Name: "Blue PiG", Tagline: "A pig in blue.",
    Mascot: mascot, Palette: palette,
})
```

Rust uses `ctx.register_sprite(&SpriteDefinition { .. })`, Python `ctx.register_sprite(SpriteDefinition(...))`, and Node `await ctx.ui.registerSprite({ id, name, tagline, mascot, palette })`. Register the sprite in `session_start`. The sprite appears after the built-in sprites in `/sprite list` and the picker, and `/sprite set <id>` saves it. When the extension is not loaded, the header draws `pig-default` and the saved choice stays.

## Choosing a source form

Pig accepts exactly one conventional factory or exact standalone form.

| Language | Factory | Standalone |
|---|---|---|
| Go | importable `func Extension() *sdk.Extension` package | exact module with executable `package main` |
| Rust | `src/lib.rs` with `pub fn new_extension() -> Extension` | exact crate with `src/main.rs` only |
| Python | one module with `def new_extension() -> Extension` | executable `main.py` with a shebang |
| Node | Pi-compatible default export | exact executable script with a shebang |
| Native | n/a | exact executable file |

Go, Rust, and Python factories may share a generated language cell. Node
factories remain isolated under the approved D20 runtime boundary. Every
standalone remains isolated. Pig rejects mixed languages, several factories,
factory-plus-standalone roots, nonstandard factory symbols, missing entrypoints,
and identity mismatches. A direct directory uses its directory name as the
expected identity. A Package or Piglet supplies its declared member name.
Select a narrower exact root instead of relying on scan order.

A Piglet Binary may fuse a compatible Go factory into Pig's process. Fused code must return errors and use extension host/UI APIs for output. The build rejects `os.Exit`, `os.Chdir`, `log.Fatal*`, `fmt.Print*`, and `os.Stdout` in the factory's local package closure with `PIGLET_FUSED_PROCESS_HAZARD` because those operations would terminate Pig, change its working directory, or corrupt terminal output.

Use `pig extension init <path>` to create a factory. Add `--isolated` to create
a standalone. The scaffold writes no extension metadata file.

### Portable staged SDK resolution

`pig extension init` writes versioned SDK dependencies without machine-local
paths. During a source build, Pig resolves an un-replaced Go requirement on
`github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk` or an un-pathed Rust `pig-sdk`
dependency to the SDK staged by the running binary under the active config
root. The build uses a temporary Go modfile or Cargo patch and never edits the
authored `go.mod` or `Cargo.toml`. An explicit valid author replacement or path
wins. If staged material is missing, run `pig reload`.

Pig 0.84 Go factories import the SDK as
`github.com/mainstai/pig/extensions/sdk`. Pig still loads these factories and exact standalones. The builder resolves that legacy path to a private copy of the running binary's complete SDK module, rewrites SDK self-imports under the alias, and ignores the extension's own replacement for it. Authored sources and module files remain unchanged. Legacy factories share cells
only with other legacy factories. They are never fused into a Piglet Binary,
because their `*sdk.Extension` is a distinct Go type. Change the import path and
the `go.mod` requirement to fuse one.

## Go SDK nullable values

Keep `ContextUsage.Tokens` and `Percent` as pointers. Nil means unknown after compaction; a pointer to zero means known zero. `GetContextUsage()` can itself return nil when no usable model window exists. Check presence before arithmetic or select an explicit fallback with `TokensOr` / `PercentOr`. `sdk.Bool(true)` and `sdk.Bool(false)` construct optional booleans; nil leaves the option unset. See `extensions/sdk/README.md` for the 0.3.0 breaking-change migration examples. These helpers do not change the wire or any callback lifetime.

## Factory contracts

### Go

```go
package myext

import sdk "github.com/MichaelKinsy/PiG/extensions/sdk"

func Extension() *sdk.Extension {
    ext := sdk.New("my-go-ext")
    ext.Tool("hello", "Say hello", sdk.Schema{"type": "object"}, func(ctx sdk.Context, params map[string]any) (any, error) {
        return map[string]any{"content": "hello"}, nil
    })
    return ext
}
```

The package can use ordinary helper and `internal` packages. A module or
workspace root with several factory packages is ambiguous and reports every
candidate. Select one exact package directory. Pig keeps its containing module
or workspace as the compiler closure. `NewExtension` and other factory symbols
are not accepted.

### Rust

```rust
pub fn new_extension() -> pig_sdk::Extension {
    let mut ext = pig_sdk::Extension::new("my-rust-ext");
    ext.tool("hello", "Say hello", pig_sdk::empty_schema(), |_ctx, _args| {
        pig_sdk::ToolResult::json(serde_json::json!({"content": "hello"}))
    });
    ext
}
```

Keep the factory in `src/lib.rs`. Use only `src/main.rs` for standalone form.

### Python

```python
import pig_sdk


def new_extension() -> pig_sdk.Extension:
    ext = pig_sdk.Extension("my-python-ext")
    ext.tool("hello", "Say hello", {"type": "object"}, lambda ctx, args: {"content": "hello"})
    return ext
```

One selected root can contain only one module with this factory.

### Node

Export one Pi-compatible default extension function. Pig runs each Node factory
in an isolated Node subprocess. Import the canonical API from
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Pig supplies the compatible runtime module.

Use `@michaelkinsy/pig-extension-types` during development when the extension
uses a PiG-only API such as `ui.setLogin`. The declaration package pins the
exact Pi version from `coding.UpstreamVersion`; it does not provide a second
runtime implementation. See `extensions/sdk-ts/README.md`.

## Contributing an OAuth provider

Register OAuth only through the runtime provider declaration. `pig login --list`
resolves enabled extensions. For each source extension without a valid
projection for its exact source configuration and immutable artifact digest,
Pig starts it for registration inspection, collects OAuth provider declarations,
and stops it without dispatching session or capability handlers. A valid
projection avoids startup. Embedded packed members are inspected independently
through the complete compiled artifact. Duplicate provider IDs fail and name
both owners. Login then starts only the owning extension. Embedded and fused
extensions use the same registration contract.

The host builds a proxy that RPCs the provider's closures; a login closure drives
the host UI through callbacks. Only the closures you set are advertised; a
credential store is optional (when set, the provider owns credential persistence
instead of `auth.json`).

Set `IsSubscription` in Go, `is_subscription` in Rust or Python, or `config.oauth.isSubscription` in Node when the OAuth method is subscription-backed. The default is false. The host retains this metadata at registration, so reading it does not call the extension. The stock footer shows `(sub)` only when the active provider has both a stored OAuth credential and this flag. OAuth alone does not imply a subscription. Kimi Coding keeps Pi's explicit API-key subscription exception.

Go:

```go
ext.RegisterProvider("example-provider", sdk.ProviderConfig{
    "name": "Example Provider",
    "oauth": &sdk.OAuthProvider{
        Login: func(cb *sdk.OAuthLoginCallbacks) (sdk.OAuthCredentials, error) {
            cb.OnDeviceCode(sdk.OAuthDeviceCodeInfo{UserCode: code, VerificationURI: url})
            // ... poll for approval ...
            return sdk.OAuthCredentials{Access: token}, nil
        },
        GetAPIKey:       func(c sdk.OAuthCredentials) string { return c.Access },
        CredentialStore: myStore, // optional; implements sdk.OAuthCredentialStore
    },
})
```

Rust: `ext.register_oauth_provider("example-provider", json!({"name": "Example Provider"}), OAuthProvider { login: Box::new(|cb| ...), .. })`.

Python: `ext.register_oauth_provider("example-provider", {"name": "Example Provider"}, OAuthProvider(login=..., ...))`.

Value-returning callbacks (`OnPrompt`/`OnSelect`/`OnManualCodeInput`) return the
user's input or an `ErrOAuthCancelled`/`OAuthCancelled` error on dismissal.

## Validation

Validate one extension:

```bash
go run ./cmd/pig install --validate-only --json ./examples/extensions/python-factory
```

Validate a set and inspect placement decisions:

```bash
go run ./cmd/pig install --validate-only --json ./ext-a ./ext-b
```

A conventional Go, Rust, or Python factory is packable. A Node factory and
every standalone stay isolated.

## Autocomplete provider factories

`AddAutocompleteProvider` / `add_autocomplete_provider` appends a factory. PiG rebuilds the ordered chain over a fresh base and completes the call after installation. A factory receives the real current provider. Keep per-query state on the returned provider, not on a newly created query wrapper. Node uses Pi's factory signature. Go, Rust and Python callbacks receive their current SDK context explicitly.

Go uses `sdk.AutocompleteProviderFactory` and `sdk.AutocompleteProvider`. Rust uses `AutocompleteProviderFactory` and `Arc<AutocompleteProvider>`. Python accepts a callable that returns an object with `get_suggestions` and `apply_completion`. Each provider can declare trigger characters and an optional file-trigger callback. Cursor columns count UTF-16 code units in every SDK.

Delegate methods that the wrapper does not change. For example, a Go wrapper can return `ApplyCompletion: current.ApplyCompletion` and `ShouldTriggerFileCompletion: current.ShouldTriggerFileCompletion`, then implement `GetSuggestions` to await `current.GetSuggestions(ctx, lines, cursorLine, cursorCol, force)` and filter its returned items. Use the callback's current context for cancellation and host calls.

The host runs queries off the TUI loop. New input cancels stale requests. A forced query does not hold typing while it awaits suggestions. Synchronous completion and trigger callbacks preserve input order through the owner loop. A real query failure reaches Pi's uncaught-error path; cancellation is not a failure. Reload and disconnect release owned factories and captured provider references. Headless and RPC no-op UI contexts do not execute factories.

## Adding a new extension API surface

1. Read upstream pi behavior in `docs/extensions.md` or upstream source.
2. Add/confirm protocol shape in `coding/extension/host/subprocess/protocol.go`.
3. Wire host behavior in `coding/extension/host/subprocess/`.
4. Add matching Go, Rust, and Python SDK behavior (`extensions/sdk`, `extensions/sdk-rs`, `extensions/sdk-py`).
5. Update the Node compatibility runtime and `extensions/sdk-ts` declarations when the surface is available to Node extensions.
6. Add or extend `test/extension-conformance` so every runtime matches the in-process reference.
7. Update `docs/extension-api-parity.md`.
8. Add a numbered divergence only when parity is impossible or intentionally rejected.
